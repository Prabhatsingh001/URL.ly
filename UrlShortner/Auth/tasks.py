"""
Asynchronous Celery tasks for email notifications in the Auth application.

This module handles all email communications as background tasks using Celery,
ensuring that email sending doesn't block the main application flow. Each task:
- Supports both HTML and plain text email formats
- Uses Django templates for email content
- Handles failures silently to prevent user-facing errors
- Accepts IDs instead of model instances for better serialization

All tasks are registered with Celery using the @shared_task decorator for
flexibility in task queue configuration.
