Signal handlers for Auth application user management.

This module implements Django signal handlers that automatically:
1. Send welcome emails to newly registered users
2. Create user profiles when new users are registered

All handlers are connected to the post_save signal of the User model
and are automatically registered when the Auth app is loaded.
